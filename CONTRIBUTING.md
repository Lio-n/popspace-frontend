# With Contributing Guide

Hi there, thanks for helping improve With! Here's a quick rundown of how to be sure your change is approved:

## Adding code

1. Use a Prettier formatter in your editor, configured to utilize our `.prettierrc` file for config.
2. Use helpful, descriptive, and brief commit messages.

## Opening a PR

1. Open your PR against the `dev` branch.
2. Pay attention to the PR description template and follow any instructions there.

## Merging your PR

1. Merge your PR with the "Squash and Merge" strategy. If that's not what your green button says, use the dropdown to select it.
2. Check the contents of your squash commit and modify them so that they accurately describe _all_ the changes your PR will make on the main branch.
