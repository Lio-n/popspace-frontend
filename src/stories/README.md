The stories in this directory are for inspecting the theming of our Material UI components and any other components we import from external libraries.

We might also want to put stories in here that are composites of multiple components.

However, if you want to add a story to a specific component, it's easier to add a `Component.stories.tsx` file next to the component itself, so it's simple to find.
